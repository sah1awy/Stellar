## About The Project  
The Stellar Classification Project is a comprehensive endeavor aimed at classifying cosmic entities based on their features through machine learning techniques, culminating in the deployment of a user-friendly Flask web application using the Render website platform.

Initially, the project involves gathering and preprocessing data on various attributes of cosmic entities, such as ultraviolet filter in the photometric system, green filter in the photometric system, red filter in the photometric system, near Infrared filter in the photometric system, etc., This data serves as the foundation for training a machine learning model to categorize stars into different classes or types.

Following data preparation, the model is developed, trained, and fine-tuned to ensure optimal performance in classifying stars. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision are utilized to assess the model's effectiveness.

Once the model is trained and validated, it is deployed as a Flask web application. Flask, a Python web framework, simplifies the process of creating web applications and allows for seamless integration with machine learning models. The Flask app is designed to receive input data from users through a user-friendly interface.

Finally, the Flask app is deployed on the Render website platform, which offers scalable and reliable hosting services. Render streamlines the deployment process, providing easy-to-use tools for hosting web applications and managing infrastructure. Through Render, the Stellar Classification Flask app becomes accessible to users worldwide, enabling them to classify stars based on their features conveniently.
